# CSinSC - Bingo!

This app was created for CSinSC to allow students to play a bingo game using terminology related to the basics of the Internet. 
The app should take a predetermined list of words, display them on clickable buttons that change colour after being clicked. The Bingo card should be able to be reset, reshuffling the words and resetting the board to it's original state. The purpose of this app is to provide an easy way for students to record the words that have come up during bingo, while making the process of creating unlimited amount of bingo cards nice and easy.
